I am a math undergraduate at Carleton College applying to grad school for Fall
2026.

I am interested in Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra, and Geometric
Topology. My CV is [here](assets/documents/Charlie_Ruppe_CV.pdf)

## Upcoming

- Joint Math Meetings, Washington DC. Presenting with Dennis Belotserkovskiy on
   our recent paper. Jan 4th.
   
## What I am working on...

My senior thesis in math illustration is looking to generate new intuition for
certain data and objects by visualizing them in non-euclidean spaces using
computer graphics.

## Research

-  "Asymptotic Invariants of Symbolic Powers of Binomial Edge Ideals" with
 Dennis Belotserkovskiy, Mariana Landín, and Lizzy Teryoshin.
 25 pages, 2025.
[Preprint.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14272){:target="_blank"}

Research on binomial edge ideals with faculty from University of
Nebraska-Lincoln at Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT) in
Mexico. Wrote and animated [an expository
video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdGTsFzHxRs){:target="_blank"} Selected
to present at Joint Mathematics Meetings.

 - "Propogation of Solutions of Binary and Ternary Quadratic Forms" with Alex
   Lattal, and Corey Brooke. 2024, In preparation.
   
Research on organizing integer solutions of quadratic forms as trees
parameterized by matrix representations of free groups.  Delivered a 25-minute
presentation on our results to our summer research peers.
  
 - "Magnetic Configurations in Mesoscale Magnetic Dots" with Grace Gatewood,
   Petros Van den Heuvel, and Barry Costanzi.

Modeled energy landscapes of 250nm permalloy dots in
Golang/Python. Implemented system for managing simulations using
Github. Assembled and operated our sputtering system, for depositing metal
features used in experiments. Processed samples, wrote LabVIEW code for
measurement taking. Used a scanning electron microscope to image our samples
for computer simulations. Results given in a poster session: ``Magnetic
Configurations in Mesoscale Magnetic Dots'' Student Research and Internship
Symposium. Carleton College, Northfield, MN, October 2023.
